					<p>Dear Parents and our Fellow Campers,</p>
					<p align="justify">Thanks for choosing our Summer Culture Immersion Program! To begin your learning adventure, there are a few things that I want to remind you.  First of all, you need to apply for our program officially online with a non-refundable application fee. In this way, your seat will be secured and you may also have a chance to earn a bonus to cover some of your program fee as an early bird. Remember, our seats are limited. We only accept 16 kids into our program and the application is closed on May 1st, 2014. </p>

					<p align="justify">Second, once your application is approved, a payment of the rest of the program fee will be required to start the visa application process. Since a bank charge occurs when you wire the fee, we would like to fully reimburse the bank charges for you. Once the payment is received, I will send an invitation letter to you together with a letter to the American Embassy for this trip. You will then need to submit all your personal information for our agency in China to start your visa application. </p>

					<p align="justify">Third, with the good news of your visa approved, our agency in China will help you book the round trip tickets from China to the United States. You will depart either from Beijing or Shanghai for this trip depending on the relatively larger number of the students we will recruit. We will contact you further about the departure city and the details of your travel arrangements. </p>

					<p align="justify">Our total program fee includes everything from round trip tickets, insurance, lodging, food, snacks, admission to the parks and the transportation for this program. However, it does not include the cost of your domestic travel to the departure city, your excess luggage fee, and the telecommunication fees occurring overseas. </p>

					<p align="justify">You may want to take a credit card with you if you have any plans to buy gifts and souvenirs in Texas. We will have a short trip to the biggest outlet mall during your stay. Parents may prepare a shopping list if you want us to assist in shopping. You will enjoy the comparative lower price and lower tax here in Texas.</p>

					<p align="justify">Last but not least, I believe you will enjoy your trip to the United States and love our program. Our colleague who will guide you here will make sure you are taken good care of and safe along the way. I cannot wait to meet you all at the Houston airport. Let’s then create a fantastic and unique cultural experience together in the summer.</p>

					<p>Yours truly, </p>
