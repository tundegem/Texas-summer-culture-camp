				<h1>More about Us</h1>
				<h2>Our Belief</h2>
				<h4 id="orange"> Learning through Experience and in the Context of Relationship.<br></h4>
					<p>One can be taught about a culture through reading or lecture, but we believe that learning through relationships with the people of the culture is key on broadening one’s mind, heart and destiny. Through our immersion program, your child will have opportunities to build relationships and in those relationships broaden their world by learning another culture.
					<br><br>Our culture immersion program is designed to give your child an experience of a lifetime through 21 days of immersion with an American family and friends. 
					</p>
				<h2>Our Culture Immersion Program</h2>
					<p>The 21 day program takes place in Austin, Texas but your child will begin the program in Houston. Participants will fly from either Beijing or Shanghai China on July 13, 2014 and return August 3, 2014. The cost is ￥43900 and it includes airfare, health insurance, transportation to events and activities, food, snacks, lodging and entry fees to all activities. The maximum number of students accepted is sixteen.
					</p>
				<h2>The Founder's Story</h2>
					<img src="images/familyphoto.jpg" width="500" height="370">
					<br>
					<p>Daniel Evans and his wife Karen have organized and participated in various events helping internationals understand and be an integral part of the American culture since 1986. Daniel lived in the southern part of China for 8 years, so he loves and understands the Chinese culture. He has made many Chinese friends who are living all over China and still remains friends with many. For the past 12 years, Daniel and Karen have developed different programs to help international students attending the University of Texas understand the American culture. Many international students have lived with the Evans family as well. The Evans discovered that students who lived with them increased their understanding of the American culture, language skills, and most importantly, enjoyed developing their friendship. This led to their desire to provide an opportunity for more students. The idea behind the American Academy of Culture is to provide a learning experience in a family atmosphere. They believe in “Learning through Experience and in the Context of Relationship.” The Evans will treat your child as once of their own and your child will have a once in a life time experience of being a part of an American family, which may benefit his/her future study and life.
